Hacker News mobile web app
==========================

This is one of my silly mini-projects. I create this initially to try out iOS 5 Mobile Safari's new `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` CSS support. I needed some sort of content for scrolling, so why not Hacker News' stories?

Technical stuff
---------------

This mobile web app primarily works on iOS 5 Mobile Safari. It uses these wonderful scripts:

- [OverflowScrollingFix](https://github.com/cubiq/OverflowScrollingFix)
- [Amplify.Store](http://amplifyjs.com/api/store/)
- Vanilla JavaScript

Also uses the [unofficial Hacker News API](http://hndroidapi.appspot.com/) built by Gleb Popov.
